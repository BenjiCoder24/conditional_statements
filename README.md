## Introduction to Python Control Structures

In this tutorial, we will delve into Python's control structures, focusing on `if` statements, `if-else` structures, and `for` loops. These are fundamental to creating conditional logic and repetitions in your code, allowing for more complex and dynamic programs.

## Understanding `if` Statements

`if` statements in Python allow you to execute a block of code only if a specified condition is true.

```python
if condition:
    # code to execute if condition is true
```

## Exploring `if-else` and `elif`

The `if-else` structure lets you execute one block of code if a condition is true, and another block if the condition is false. `elif` (else if) is used to check multiple conditions.

```python
if condition:
    # code if condition is true
else:
    # code if condition is false
```

## Diving into `for` Loops

A `for` loop in Python is used to iterate over a sequence (like a list, tuple, dictionary, or string), executing a block of code with each iteration.

```python
for item in sequence:
    # code to execute
```

## Practical Example: Combining `if` Statements with `for` Loops

Combining `if` statements with `for` loops allows for conditional execution of code within a loop. This is useful for filtering items, accumulating values conditionally, and more.

```python
for item in sequence:
    if condition:
        # code to execute if condition is met
```

## Conclusion

This tutorial covered the basics of using `if` statements, `if-else` and `elif` structures, and `for` loops in Python. These control structures are the building blocks for creating complex logic in your programs.

Happy coding!
